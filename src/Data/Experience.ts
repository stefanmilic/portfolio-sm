    text: `I worked at GNation on several projects. On each one of them i have used various technologies.
    Main structure was with React, Typescript and Sass. But in addition to these technologies we used Redux, Redux-saga, Recompose, Webocket, ContextApi, Hooks, React-router, Oauth2 authentication with Jwt tokens and tons of libraries. For every front app we used middleware, which was written in nodejs with express framework, for mapping fields, handling request, writing tests, everything that help for our front app be clear as much as possible.
    But the most important thing we wrote was clean and readable code without performance issues.
    I constantly collaborated closely with the team to support projects during all phases of delivery.`,

    how one serious institution works. And i started with basic stuff,
    maintenance website, computer networking, programming routers and
    checking the hardware's correctness. After one month I started
    receiving the salary. This job gave me opportunity for better
    acquainting with HTML, CSS, Java Script, Web services and how
    information system works and what it consists of.`,
